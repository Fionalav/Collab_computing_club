			<h1>Welcome to the the Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club!</h1>

			<p>The group is run by Julia Wrobel and Ariel Chernofsky under faculty advisor
				<a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/cmm2212">Christine Mauro</a>
				in the <a href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics">
				Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University</a>.</p>

		  <p>We host causal monthly seminars focusing on computational topics often encountered in Biostatistics
				research.  The tutorials provide hands-on learning at a variety of skill levels,
				with some focused on bringing new students up to speed and others addressing more advanced problems.
				Our overarching goal is to impart good programming practices that encourage collaborative
				 reproducible research! See the <a href="/schedule">schedule</a> for a list of upcoming meetings.
