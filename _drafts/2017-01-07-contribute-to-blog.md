Since this is a student-run group the goal is for any of you affiliated with the Columbia biostatistics network 
to be able to post content so you can share it with your fellow students. In order for that to happen, 
I have laid out the steps for you to (1) become a GitHub member, (2) get access to the repository for this website, and 
(2) start writing your own blog post.
